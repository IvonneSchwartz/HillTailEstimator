# HillTailEstimator

The tail behaviour of power law distributions can be described by the tail index alpha.  A well-known estimator for alpha is the Hill estimator which is the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) for a power law distribution. The hill estimator is used e.g. to capture extreme events (heavy tails) of financial returns.
